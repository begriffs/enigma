Enigma came from a discussion I had with friends about the worst
possible web design.  We decided nothing could be worse than a page
which looks entirely different every time it loads. That's what
Enigma does; it is a snippet of JavaScript which adds dynamic and
unpredictable CSS effects to a webpage. You can control the likelihood
of certain effects from within the source.
